# Sample Data API Server

Welcome! This document explains the **Sample Data API Server**, which is a simple, local Express server designed to provide mock data for your development and testing needs.

## What It Does

This server runs locally on your machine (defaulting to `http://localhost:3001`) and exposes several REST API endpoints. It serves hardcoded JSON data for common application elements like software features, weather, news, and stock prices.

## Why It Exists

When you're building a new frontend application or a component, you often need a reliable, quick source of data without the hassle of setting up a full database or dealing with external API rate limits and keys.

This server solves that problem by giving you a **dependency-free, local mock backend**. You can start building your UI immediately, knowing the data structure will be consistent.

## How to Use It

To get this server running, you'll need **Node.js** installed on your system.

### 1. Setup

1.  Save the provided code as a file named `server.js`.
2.  Open your terminal in the same directory and install the required packages:

    ```bash
npm install express cors
    ```

### 2. Run the Server

Start the server using Node.js:

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see the confirmation message: `API running at http://localhost:3001`.

### 3. Available Endpoints

You can now access the following endpoints from your browser or any HTTP client (like `fetch` or Postman):

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/api/features` | Returns the full list of sample software features. |
| `GET` | `/api/feature/random` | Returns a single, randomly selected feature. |
| `GET` | `/api/get-weather` | Returns static sample weather data. |
| `GET` | `/api/get-news` | Returns a list of static sample news articles. |
| `GET` | `/api/get-stocks` | Returns a list of static sample stock prices. |

## Important Limitations

Keep in mind that this is a **mock server** for development purposes:

*   **Static Data:** All data is hardcoded in the `server.js` file. Any changes you make to the data will require restarting the server.
*   **No Persistence:** There is no database. You cannot use `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` requests to modify the data.
*   **CORS Enabled:** The server uses `cors()` to allow requests from any origin, which is great for local development but **not secure for production use**.

## Real-World Example

Here is how you might fetch the list of all features in a React component or a simple JavaScript file:

```javascript
async function fetchFeatures() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/features');
    const result = await response.json();
    
    if (result.success) {
      console.log('Total features:', result.count);
      console.log('First feature:', result.data[0]);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Could not fetch features:', error);
  }
}

fetchFeatures();
```

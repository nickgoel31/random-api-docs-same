---title: Homepage Features Component---# Customizing Your Homepage FeaturesThe `HomepageFeatures` component is your friendly guide to quickly showcasing the best parts of your project right on your Docusaurus landing page. It's designed to be simple to use and easy to customize!## What This Component DoesThis component is a reusable React element that takes a list of features and renders them in a clean, responsive, three-column layout. It's the perfect way to give visitors a quick, visually appealing overview of your project's core benefits.## Why It ExistsWhen someone first visits your documentation site, you have a very short window to grab their attention. This component solves the problem of needing a structured, visually consistent way to present your project's key selling points without having to write complex CSS or layout code from scratch. It lets you focus on the content, and Docusaurus handles the presentation.## How to Use and Customize ItYou can easily customize the features by editing the `FeatureList` array within the component file.### Step 1: Locate the FileThe component logic is located in:`docs/src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.js`### Step 2: Modify the FeatureListAll the content for the feature cards is stored in the `FeatureList` array. To customize a feature, simply edit the corresponding object:```javascriptconst FeatureList = [  {    title: 'Easy to Use',    Svg: require('@site/static/img/undraw_docusaurus_mountain.svg').default,    description: (      <>        Docusaurus was designed from the ground up to be easily installed and        used to get your website up and running quickly.      </>    ),  },  // ... other features];```### Step 3: Customize the Properties*   **`title`**: This is the main heading for the feature card. Keep it concise!*   **`Svg`**: This is the path to the SVG image that will be displayed as the icon. **Important:** You must place your custom SVG files in the `static/img/` directory and use the `require('@site/static/img/your-file-name.svg').default` syntax to load them correctly.*   **`description`**: This is a short, descriptive paragraph. Since it uses JSX (`<>...</>`), you can include HTML elements like `<code>` or `<strong>` for formatting.### Adding or Removing FeaturesTo add a new feature, simply add a new object to the `FeatureList` array. To remove one, delete its object. The component will automatically adjust the layout.## Important Considerations*   **Layout Limit:** The component uses a standard Docusaurus grid that displays up to three features per row on desktop. If you add more than three features, they will automatically wrap to the next line, maintaining the three-column structure.*   **Icon Format:** The component is specifically set up to handle **SVG** files loaded via `require()`. If you need to use other image formats (like PNG or JPG), you will need to modify the `Feature` component's `Svg` prop to handle a standard `<img>` tag instead of rendering the component as an SVG.## Real-World ExampleLet's say you want to highlight a new feature called "Community Support" and use a custom icon named `undraw_community.svg`.```javascript// In docs/src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.jsconst FeatureList = [  // ... (existing features)  {    title: 'Community Support',    Svg: require('@site/static/img/undraw_community.svg').default,    description: (      <>        Join our friendly community on Discord or GitHub for quick answers        and help from fellow developers!      </>    ),  },];```This simple change immediately updates your homepage, giving your visitors a great first impression!

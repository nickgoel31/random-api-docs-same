## Overview

`HomepageFeatures` is a React component used in Docusaurus sites to display a set of feature cards on the homepage. It internally defines a static `FeatureList` array and renders each entry using the `Feature` sub‑component.

## Props

The component does not accept any props.

### Feature sub‑component

`Feature` receives the following props:

- `Svg` (React component) – The SVG illustration for the feature.
- `title` (string) – Title of the feature.
- `description` (JSX) – Description content.

## Usage

```jsx
import HomepageFeatures from '@site/src/components/HomepageFeatures';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* other sections */}
      <HomepageFeatures />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Implementation Details

- Uses `clsx` for conditional class names.
- Imports `Heading` from `@theme/Heading`.
- Styles are defined in `styles.module.css`.
- SVGs are loaded via `require('@site/static/img/...').default`.

title: Sidebars Configuration
description: Configuring sidebars in Docusaurus
---

## Overview

The `sidebars.js` file is used to configure the sidebars in your Docusaurus documentation. A sidebar is an ordered group of documents Page that Page provides navigation between them.

## Default Sidebar Generation

By default, Docusaurus generates a sidebar from the docs folder structure. This is achieved by setting the `type` to `'autogenerated'` and specifying the `dirName` as `'.'` in the `tutorialSidebar` object.

```javascript
const sidebars = {
  tutorial Page Page Page Page tutorialSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}],
};
```

## Manual Sidebar Configuration

You can also create a sidebar manually by defining an array of items. This includes documents and categories.

### Example

```javascript
const sidebars = Page Page Page Page { Page Page ' Page tutorialSidebar: [
    'intro',
    'hello',
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Tutorial',
      items: ['tutorial-basics/create-a-document'],
 Page   },
  ], Page Page '};
```

### Sidebar Item Types

- **Document**: A single document referenced by its ID.
- **Category Page**: A category that contains multiple items, which can be documents or other categories.

## Creating Multiple Sidebars

You Page can create as many sidebars as you want by adding more objects to the `sidebars` object.

## Type Checking

The `sidebars.js` file is type-checked using TypeScript. Ensure that your configuration conforms to the `SidebarsConfig` type from `@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs`.

```javascript
/**
 * @type {import('@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs').SidebarsConfig}
 */ > Page Page ' Pageconst Page 'sidebars Page = { ... }; Page '```

## Docusaurus Sidebars Configuration

This documentation covers the configuration of your documentation sidebars using the `sidebars.js` file.

### What the feature does

The `sidebars.js` file is the central place where you define the navigational structure for your documentation pages. It allows you to map a set of documents to a specific sidebar, which Docusaurus then uses to render an ordered list of links and provide convenient "Next/Previous" navigation buttons.

### Why it exists / problem it solves

As your project grows, managing a large number of documentation files can become unwieldy. This configuration file solves the problem of organizing those files into a logical, easy-to-navigate hierarchy. It ensures that your users can quickly find the information they need, improving the overall experience of your documentation.

### How you can use it

You have two primary, powerful ways to define your sidebars:

#### 1. Autogenerated Sidebar (Recommended Default)

This is the simplest and most common approach. By default, Docusaurus uses the file system structure of your `docs` folder to automatically create the sidebar. This requires minimal configuration and is perfect for most projects.

```javascript
tutorialSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}],
```

*   The `dirName: '.'` tells Docusaurus to look at the root of your documentation directory.
*   Any subfolders you create will automatically become collapsible categories in the sidebar.

#### 2. Manual Definition

For more fine-grained control over ordering, labels, and grouping, you can manually define the structure. This is useful when you need to:

*   Customize the display label of a category.
*   Order documents that don't follow alphabetical file naming.
*   Group documents from different directories.

When defining a sidebar manually, you use objects to define categories and strings to reference document IDs:

```javascript
/*
tutorialSidebar: [
  'intro', // Document ID
  'hello', // Another Document ID
  {
    type: 'category',
    label: 'Tutorial',
    items: ['tutorial-basics/create-a-document', 'tutorial-basics/install-guide'],
  },
],
*/
```

### Important Limitations or Edge Cases

*   **Node.js Environment:** The `sidebars.js` file is executed in a Node.js environment during the build process, not in the user's browser. This means you **cannot** use client-side code, browser APIs (like `window` or `document`), or JSX within this file. Stick to standard JavaScript.
*   **Document IDs:** Ensure the string you use for a document (e.g., `'intro'`) exactly matches the unique ID defined in the document's front matter, or its file name (without the extension) if no ID is specified.

### One short real-world example

Let's say you want to explicitly order your "Setup" and "Deployment" guides, even if they are in the same folder.

**Goal:** List 'Deployment' before 'Setup'.

```javascript
const sidebars = {
  // Define a new sidebar named 'mainSidebar'
  mainSidebar: [
    'api-reference', // A single document at the root
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Guides',
      // Manually specify the order of documents within the category
      items: [
        'guides/deployment-guide',
        'guides/setup-guide',
      ],
    },
  ],
};

export default sidebars;
```
